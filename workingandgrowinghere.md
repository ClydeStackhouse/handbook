## Annual Review Cadence

<aside>
üåè **Note that all dates below are formatted by US dates, so it will be MM/DD**

</aside>

### There are two types of review cycles at dbt Labs.

[Performance Reviews at dbt Labs](https://www.notion.so/Performance-Reviews-at-dbt-Labs-054564274f6042a09e1e8515df579e06) 

[Compensation Reviews and Promotion Cycles](https://www.notion.so/Compensation-Reviews-and-Promotion-Cycles-3cd43b727be1471c991cb6964bae4ccd) 

### Cadence

<aside>
üëâ Each review cycle happens twice per year, meaning we have 4 cycles **total**.

</aside>

Because of the relationship between performance, and compensation/ promotions, the review cycles are close together, while being separate. This also means that our operating calendar has space for large events (company kick off and Coalesce, for example) to happen without a review cycle in tandem.

This data cut is Tech (enterprise) companies that have raised over $250 Million in capital and all US.

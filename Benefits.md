### Benefits Strategy and Philosophy

As dbt Labs continues to grow and expand around the world, we believe it’s important that outline our strategy and philosophy around global benefits. The following points are guiding principles that we strive towards and will drive the decision-making around our benefits both domestically and abroad.

- We strive to provide benefits that are both locally relevant and competitive
    - Each Country’s benefits will differ based on local normals and local competition for benefits.
- Our benefit offerings and coverage will grow and progress as local team sizes grow due to economies of scale and eligibility in various plans
    - If local teams aren’t large enough to begin group plans, we’ll provide monthly stipends to cover core benefits (Medical, Vision & Dental - Where applicable)
- Values aligned: We are Human → Although we may not be able to implement every benefit or offering we understand that we bring our whole selves to work and we want to hear and respond to feedback

### How is this impacting today?

Today our international team falls into one of two buckets. 

**Employed through an EOR (Employee of Record) -** Employees that are hired and work for an EOR are subject to the benefits offerings that are provided through their service. However, we will operate within our philosophy above which means we will elect premium coverage and options as they become available through the EOR. Additionally, all related perks remain available and intact (ie. Office stipends, Professional Development, etc)

**Employed through a dbt Labs local entity** - Employees that are hired and work for local entities in a country with less than 10 local employees will be provided a locally relevant and competitive monthly stipend amount to reimburse some of the cost associated with finding personal coverage for core supplemental benefits (Medical, Vision & Dental), where applicable. All mandatory benefits, pension schemes, etc will be provided to comply with local laws and regulations. 

As employee counts grow to local relevant critical mass for group plans and will then be able to work with our Global Benefits Broker to shop and obtain group plans that would replace the stipend amount. It’s important to note that our employee count has a direct impact on the options and plans that will be available as well as navigating appropriate economies of scale when determining supplemental benefits.

### Local Entity Medical Benefit Stipends

The following stipend amounts have been developed to help cover some of the cost to acquire additional supplemental insurance until we are able to offer local group plans. You can use this stipend to cover core benefits like medical, dental, vision, Life & disability for yourself and dependents if applicable.

### Receiving the Benefits Stipend

The benefits stipend will automatically be added to your monthly payroll. You do not need to request for a reimbursement through Airbase.

### **Retirement & Pension Plans**

As previously mentioned we look to target locally relevant and competitive benefit options and retirement and pension plans fall under the same philosophy. We are currently working towards getting each required Pension scheme and retirement plan solidified. More details will be forthcoming.
